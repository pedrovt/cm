## Objectives
Build an app that acts as a dialler, with a “keypad” to enter the number to call.
When you press the dial button, a call should be started.

You should add a set of 3 “speed dial” buttons.
When the user does a long press on one of these “speed dials”, a secondary activity
is offered to allow the user to update the speed dial details (the label and associated number).

To save the definition of the speed dials SharedPreferences was used.
